# Dogecoin Prediction Final Project

## Summary: 
This project uses a machine learning model to explore the variability of dogecoin price in real time, construct a prediction curve and compare the mapping of prediction with actual data to understand the implementation of machine learning model along with learning multiple libraries usage in the modelling. This project will touch on the history and application of Dogecoin establishing the context of the project and further explain the libraries used and their core functions. Also, we'll explain how the machine learning model works and towards the end discuss the conclusion drawn out of the final graph.
